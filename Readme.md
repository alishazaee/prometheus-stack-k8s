## Introduction
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting tool that is widely used in Kubernetes environments. It provides a flexible and scalable platform for collecting, analyzing, and alerting on metrics data. Grafana, on the other hand, is a visualization and analytics platform that works seamlessly with Prometheus to create interactive and customizable dashboards.

This repository aims to simplify the setup process of the Prometheus stack on Kubernetes by providing Helm charts and configuration files. It also includes guides and best practices for configuring and customizing the stack for your specific requirements.

## Installation
To install the Prometheus stack on your Kubernetes cluster, follow the steps in the [Installation Guide](./docs/installation.md). The guide provides detailed instructions on prerequisites, Helm chart installation, and namespace configuration.

## Configuration
Once you have installed the Prometheus stack, you can customize its configuration to suit your needs. The [Configuration Guide](./docs/configuration.md) covers various aspects of configuration, such as:

- Setting up and modifying Prometheus scrape targets
- Configuring Prometheus rules and alerts
- Customizing Grafana dashboards
- Implementing service discovery for exporters
- And more...

Refer to this guide to make the necessary configuration changes based on your specific monitoring requirements.

## Accessing Prometheus and Grafana
After the installation, you can access the Prometheus and Grafana interfaces to view, query, and analyze metrics data. The [Access Guide](./docs/access.md) explains how to access Prometheus and Grafana from your local machine or within the Kubernetes cluster.

The guide also covers topics like authentication, SSL termination, and securing the Prometheus and Grafana deployments.

## Alerting
Alerting is a crucial component of any monitoring system. Prometheus supports powerful alerting capabilities that allow you to define alert rules, configure receivers, and manage alerting rules. The [Alerting Guide](./docs/alerting.md) provides details on setting up and managing alerts in Prometheus.

It covers topics such as defining alerting rules, using recording rules, configuring notification channels, and integrating with external services like PagerDuty or Slack.
